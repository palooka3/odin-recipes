    <h3>How to Make the Best Cornbread</h3>
    <p>I absolutely love cornbread. My wife makes the best cornbread you have ever had, and here's the secret: It's Jiffy from a box!</p>
    <p>This cornbread is quick and easy to make, and it comes out perfect and fluffy every time. I slather this with butter and eat a slice or two with dinner.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
    <ul>
        <li>1 box Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix</li>
        <li>1/3 cup milk (or half and half)</li>
        <li>1 egg</li> 
        <li>2 TBSP canola oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3> 
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Prepare a pie pan or baking dish and spray with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine all ingredients and stir well with a wire whisk.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into pan and bake for approximately 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly. Slather with butter and serve!</li>
    </ol>
