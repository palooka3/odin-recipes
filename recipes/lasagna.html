        <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 (28 ounce) jar of spaghetti sauce</li> 
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li> 
            <li>1/2 onion, chopped</li> 
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li> 
            <li>2 teaspoons dried basil (optional)</li> 
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>2 cups dried mafalda noodles</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul> 

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add spaghetti sauce, tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook over low heat until sauce is hot, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook mafalda noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li> 
            <li>Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely coated. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li> 
            <li>Place skillet under the hot broil and cook until cheese is golden and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
